I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at ENS de Lyon, in the [Unité de Mathématiques pures et appliquées (UMPA)](https://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/recherche/equipe-de-theorie-et-des-nombres), working with [Benjamin Wesolowski](https://www.bweso.com/). My main research interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based cryptography, and computational number theory.

Previously, I completed my PhD at University College London, as part of the [CDT for Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/) and the [Information Security group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Philipp Jovanovic](https://philipp.jovanovic.io/) and [Sarah Meiklejohn](https://smeiklej.com/). 


Before starting my PhD, I completed my Undergraduate and Master's degree in Mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/), specialising in Algebraic Number Theory and Elliptic Curves.

Organiser of [The Isogeny Club](https://isogeny.club/), together with [Jonathan Komada Eriksen](https://jonathke.github.io/).

I am passionate about communicating cryptography and mathematics to others, and have written a series of [blog posts on isogeny-based cryptography](https://mariascrs.github.io/posts.html), as well as giving a number of outreach [talks](https://mariascrs.github.io/talks.html) to STEM students.

The manuscript of my thesis is available <a href="../files/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
